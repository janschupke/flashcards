## Adaptive Learning System Explained

### Character Selection Algorithm
The app uses a simple weighted selection algorithm that ensures characters you're struggling with or that are new get prioritized:

**Selection Distribution:**
- **70% of selections** come from unsuccessful or new characters
  - Unsuccessful characters (low success rate) get highest priority
  - New/untested characters get increased priority (but lower than unsuccessful)
- **30% of selections** come from successful characters
  - Weighted by inverse success rate (lower success = higher weight)

**Character Categories:**
1. **Unsuccessful/Untested Characters** (<50% success OR 0 attempts)
   - 70% of all selections
   - Unsuccessful: weighted by inverse success rate (lower success = higher weight)
   - Untested: fixed weight (0.8, lower than max unsuccessful)
2. **Successful Characters** (≥50% success rate)
   - 30% of all selections
   - Weighted by inverse success rate (lower success = higher weight)

**Configuration:**
- Unsuccessful threshold: <50% success rate
- Selection distribution: 70% unsuccessful/untested, 30% successful

### Range Expansion
The app automatically expands your practice range as you improve:
- **Starting Range:** First 100 characters
- **Expansion Check:** Every 10 answers (EXPANSION_INTERVAL)
- **Expansion Criteria:**
  - ≥80% **overall** success rate (across all attempts, not just last 10)
  - At least 10 total attempts (MIN_ATTEMPTS_FOR_EXPANSION)
- **Expansion Amount:** +10 characters per expansion
- **Maximum Range:** 1,500 characters (full dataset)

**Note:** The success rate is calculated from your overall performance (total correct / total attempted), not just the last 10 answers. The system checks this every 10 answers.

When your range expands, you'll see a toast notification at the top of the screen.

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

This project is pre-configured for [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with optimal settings for a React SPA.

#### Prerequisites
- A [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup) (free tier works)
- Your code pushed to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket

#### Deployment Steps

1. **Push to Git:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Import to Vercel:**
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Import your repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect the following settings:
     - **Framework Preset:** Vite
     - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
     - **Output Directory:** `dist`
     - **Install Command:** `npm install`

3. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will build and deploy your app
   - You'll get a production URL (e.g., `your-app.vercel.app`)

#### Vercel Configuration

The project includes `vercel.json` for SPA routing:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

This ensures all routes (e.g., `/history`, `/statistics`) work correctly in production.

#### Environment Variables

**No environment variables required** - the app works out of the box with default settings.

#### Custom Domain

1. In Vercel project settings, go to "Domains"
2. Add your custom domain
3. Follow DNS configuration instructions
4. Vercel will automatically provision SSL certificates

#### Continuous Deployment

- Every push to `main` branch triggers automatic deployment
- Pull requests get preview deployments automatically
- Deployments are instant and zero-downtime

#### Local Production Testing

Before deploying, test the production build locally:
```bash
# Build the production bundle
npm run build

# Preview the production build
npm run preview
```

This serves the optimized build at `http://localhost:4173` (or similar) to verify everything works correctly.

## Configuration

All adaptive learning parameters can be configured in `src/constants/adaptive.ts`:

```typescript
export const ADAPTIVE_CONFIG = {
  // Selection algorithm
  MIN_ATTEMPTS_FOR_ADAPTIVE: 3,     // Attempts needed before adaptive selection activates

  // Success rate threshold for categorization
  UNSUCCESSFUL_THRESHOLD: 0.5,      // <50% = unsuccessful (untested also in this group)

  // Weighting constants
  UNTESTED_WEIGHT: 0.8,             // Weight for untested characters (lower than max unsuccessful)
  SELECTION_SPLIT: 0.7,             // 70% for unsuccessful/untested, 30% for successful

  // Range expansion
  INITIAL_RANGE: 100,               // Starting character count
  EXPANSION_INTERVAL: 10,           // Check every N answers
  EXPANSION_AMOUNT: 10,             // Add N characters when expanding
  SUCCESS_THRESHOLD: 0.8,           // 80% success rate required for expansion
  MIN_ATTEMPTS_FOR_EXPANSION: 10,   // Minimum attempts before checking expansion

  // Storage limits
  MAX_HISTORY_ENTRIES: 100,         // Maximum history entries to store
} as const;
```
